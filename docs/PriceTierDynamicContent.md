## Card Price Tiers (Simplified)

### How Cards Are Grouped

Your card falls into one of these price ranges (we use the Fair Market Value, or if that's not available, the average asking price):

**🟢 Under $100 Cards**
- Common modern cards, base rookies, role players
- Easy to buy and sell quickly
- Most people buy these without much research

**🔵 $100 to $499 Cards**  
- Better rookies, star players, numbered cards
- Older common cards or lower-grade vintage
- Entry-level graded cards (PSA 7-9 modern)
- People think more carefully before buying

**🟣 $500 to $2,000 Cards**
- Star rookies in good condition
- Vintage Hall of Famers (even in OK condition)
- Scarcer modern cards with autographs
- **This is where buying/selling gets more serious:**
  - Buyers do more homework
  - Sellers price more carefully
  - Auctions become common
  - Mistakes at this level cost real money

**🟠 $2,000 to $10,000 Cards**
- Classic vintage cards
- Iconic modern rookies (Jordan, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.)
- Hard-to-find graded cards
- **How people behave differently:**
  - Takes longer to decide to buy
  - Condition, grading, and authenticity matter a lot
  - Some cards sell fast, others take months—depends on the player

**🔴 $10,000+ Cards (Trophy Cards)**
- Museum-quality vintage
- Key rookie cards in near-perfect condition
- Historically important cards
- **Market works differently:**
  - Often sold through major auction houses, not just eBay
  - Serious collectors and investors
  - Timing and market conditions matter
  - Whether a card sells quickly depends heavily on who's looking

## Updated Messages (Plain Language)

### Message #3: 🚨 Sellers Are Asking Too Much, Not Many Buyers

**This warning means different things depending on card price:**

---

**🟢 For Cards Under $100:**

**What's happening:**
> Sellers want {marketPressure}% more than what cards recently sold for, but not many people are buying (buyer interest score: {liquidityScore}/100). 

This means the cards are overpriced. Better deals exist elsewhere.

**What you should do:**
- **If you're thinking of buying:** Pass on this one—your money is better spent on cards where the market is healthier.
- **If you're trying to sell:** You'll probably wait a long time unless you drop your price.

---

**🔵 For Cards $100-$499:**

**What's happening:**
> Sellers want {marketPressure}% more than recent sale prices, but buyers aren't interested (buyer interest score: {liquidityScore}/100). 

The cards are priced too high. Wait for prices to come down or find better options.

**What you should do:**
- **If you want to flip it (buy to resell):** Bad idea. High prices + few buyers = hard to make money.
- **If you want it for your collection:** Wait it out. Prices will likely drop.

---

**🟣 For Cards $500-$2,000:**

**What's happening:**
> Sellers want {marketPressure}% more than recent sales, but buyers aren't biting (buyer interest score: {liquidityScore}/100). 

At this price range, buyers do their homework and won't overpay. These asking prices will probably drop or sit unsold for months.

**What you should do:**
- **If you're selling:** Price it fairly from the start. At this price level, overpriced cards sit forever, then sellers eventually cut the price anyway.
- **If you're buying:** Be patient. These prices will come down.

---

**🟠 For Cards $2,000-$10,000:**

**What's happening:**
> Sellers want {marketPressure}% more than what these cards recently sold for, and not many buyers are looking ({liquidityScore}/100 buyer interest). 

For expensive cards like this, it's normal to have fewer buyers—but when you combine that with inflated prices, it means sellers are testing the market and will probably need to lower their expectations.

**What you should do:**
- **If you're selling:** Price it right from the start. Experienced buyers at this level know the market and won't chase overpriced cards.
- **If you're collecting:** Wait it out. Expensive cards often get cheaper when sellers realize nobody's paying their asking price.

---

**🔴 For Cards $10,000+:**

**What's happening:**
> eBay listings are {marketPressure}% higher than what similar cards sold for at auctions, and not many people are watching ({liquidityScore}/100). 

For really expensive cards, there are fewer eBay sales—lots of trophy cards sell through auction houses instead. These sellers might be hoping someone pays extra to buy on eBay instead of waiting for an auction.

**What you should do:**
- **If you're collecting:** Check what these cards sold for at Heritage, PWCC, or Goldin auctions first. Big auction sales are usually more reliable for pricing trophy cards than eBay listings.

---

### Message #5: ⚡ Prices Look Fair, But Not Many People Are Buying

**This means different things based on price:**

---

**🟢 For Cards Under $100:**

**What's happening:**
> Prices are pretty normal (only {marketPressure}% vs. recent sales), but not many people are buying (buyer interest: {liquidityScore}/100). 

Even though prices are fair, the cards aren't selling well. Probably means the card is losing popularity or too many copies are for sale.

**What you should do:**
- **If you're selling:** Expect slow sales. Even with fair prices, cheap cards need lots of buyers to move.
- **If you're buying:** No rush—these will still be here.

---

**🔵 For Cards $100-$499:**

**What's happening:**
> Prices are reasonable ({marketPressure}% vs. recent sales), but sales are slow (buyer interest: {liquidityScore}/100). 

Even at fair prices, cards aren't moving. Could mean buyer interest is fading or too many are available.

**What you should do:**
- **If you want to flip it:** Not ideal. Even good deals might take a while to resell.
- **If you're collecting long-term:** Could be a quiet buying opportunity. Fair prices without hype often age well.

---

**🟣 For Cards $500-$2,000:**

**What's happening:**
> Prices look reasonable ({marketPressure}% vs. recent sales), with moderate buyer activity ({liquidityScore}/100). 

At this price range, fewer people can afford $500-$2K cards, so slower sales are normal. This isn't necessarily "people losing interest"—it's just that the pool of buyers is naturally smaller.

**What you should do:**
- **If you want to flip it:** Expect to hold it for 30-60 days even at a fair price. Factor that wait time into your plans.
- **If you're collecting long-term:** This is often a good situation—fair prices without crazy hype. If it's a historically important card or proven star, slow and steady is actually good.

---

**🟠 For Cards $2,000-$10,000:**

**What's happening:**
> Prices are fair ({marketPressure}% vs. recent sales), with moderate buyer activity ({liquidityScore}/100). 

For expensive cards, slower buying is normal and expected. Fewer people can spend $2K-$10K, and those who can take their time deciding.

**What you should do:**
- **If you're selling:** At this level, waiting 60-120+ days to sell is typical for fairly-priced cards. Fair pricing helps, but patience is required.
- **If you're collecting long-term:** Great environment. Fair prices + low drama = healthy long-term investment.

---

**🔴 For Cards $10,000+:**

**What's happening:**
> Prices match recent sales ({marketPressure}% vs. recent sales), with limited but serious buyer interest ({liquidityScore}/100). 

Trophy-level cards don't sell often. When they do, it's usually through auction houses or private sales, not eBay.

**What you should do:**
- **If you're selling:** eBay might not be the best place. Major auction houses (Heritage, PWCC, Goldin) usually find better buyers for expensive cards.
- **If you're collecting long-term:** Fair prices on trophy cards are rare opportunities, but make absolutely sure the card is real and in the condition claimed.

---

### Message #8: 📊 Normal, Stable Market

**Expectations by price level:**

---

**🟢 Cards Under $100:**
> Prices are in the middle range ({marketPressure}% vs. recent sales) and buyers seem moderately active ({liquidityScore}/100). This is a normal, stable market. Nothing special happening—use your normal judgment.

---

**🔵 Cards $100-$499:**
> Prices are in the middle range ({marketPressure}% vs. recent sales) and buyers seem moderately interested ({liquidityScore}/100). This is a normal, stable market. Not hot, not cold—good for patient buyers and sellers with fair prices.

---

**🟣 Cards $500-$2,000:**
> Prices are in the middle range ({marketPressure}% vs. recent sales) and buyer interest is moderate ({liquidityScore}/100). 

For cards at this price, moderate buyer interest is typical—there just aren't as many people buying $500-$2K cards as there are buying $50 cards. That's normal. 

**What to expect:** If you're selling, expect to wait 30-60 days to find a buyer.

---

**🟠 Cards $2,000-$10,000:**
> Prices are in the middle range ({marketPressure}% vs. recent sales) with moderate buyer interest ({liquidityScore}/100). 

At this price level, "moderate" buyer interest is actually healthy—serious buyers exist, but they take their time. 

**What to expect:** If you're listing a card, expect 60-120+ days to be normal. That's not a red flag—it's just how this price range works.

---

**🔴 Cards $10,000+:**
> Prices match recent comparables ({marketPressure}% vs. recent sales) with measured interest ({liquidityScore}/100). 

For trophy cards, eBay sales only tell part of the story—many sales happen through auction houses or privately. Use this eBay data as one piece of information, not the whole picture.

**Additional tip:** Check recent Heritage, PWCC, or Goldin auction results for additional price confirmation at this level.

## Updated Liquidity Pop-up (Plain Language)

### Title
💧 How Easy Is It to Sell This Card?

---

### What This Score Means (By Price Range)

**🟢 For Cards Under $100:**
> This score shows how hard or easy it might be to **sell your card** at a fair price. For cheap cards, a high score is normal—low scores usually mean people are losing interest in the card.

---

**🔵 For Cards $100-$499:**
> This score shows how hard or easy it might be to **sell your card** at a fair price. This price range has lots of buying and selling activity—your score directly relates to how fast you can expect to sell.

---

**🟣 For Cards $500-$2,000:**
> This score shows how hard or easy it might be to **sell your card** at a fair price. At this price level, lower scores are expected—fewer people can spend $500-$2K, and they take longer to decide. A medium score is normal and healthy.

---

**🟠 For Cards $2,000-$10,000:**
> This score shows how realistic eBay is as a place to sell your card. For expensive cards, many sales happen through auction houses or private deals, not eBay. A lower eBay score doesn't mean the card is hard to sell—just that eBay might not be the main marketplace.

---

**🔴 For Cards $10,000+:**
> This score only reflects eBay activity, which is just a small part of the trophy card market. Major auction houses (Heritage, PWCC, Goldin) often work better for finding buyers at this price level. Use these scores as extra information, not the main story.

### Score Ranges (Simplified by Price Tier)

#### 🟢 **High Score (1.0+): Selling Faster Than New Listings Appear**

**For Cheap & Mid-Price Cards (<$500):**
- **What it means:** More cards are selling than people are listing. High demand.
- **What to do:** If selling, you have the advantage. If buying, make sure the hype is real.

**For $500-$2K Cards:**
- **What it means:** Really strong demand for cards at this price—doesn't happen often. Usually means a player did something big or the card is scarce.
- **What to do:** If selling, you can probably get a good price. If buying, double-check you're not overpaying for temporary excitement.

**For $2K-$10K Cards:**
- **What it means:** Unusual for expensive cards. Often driven by major achievements (Hall of Fame, championships, records).
- **What to do:** If selling, take advantage but price fairly—serious buyers know the market. If buying, make sure you're not chasing hype.

**For $10K+ Cards:**
- **What it means:** Rare for trophy cards. Could be a major auction result making eBay buyers excited, or a massive player milestone.
- **What to do:** Check recent auction results. Sometimes eBay activity spikes 30-60 days after a big auction sale.

---

#### 🔵 **Medium Score (0.5-1.0): Normal, Steady Activity**

**For Cheap Cards (<$100):**
- **What it means:** Normal, balanced market.
- **What to do:** Business as usual.

**For $100-$499 Cards:**
- **What it means:** Healthy, functional market with regular sales.
- **What to do:** Normal conditions for buying and selling.

**For $500-$2K Cards:**
- **What it means:** This is what a healthy market looks like at this price. Normal and good.
- **What to do:** Expect 30-60 days to sell if priced fairly.

**For $2K-$10K Cards:**
- **What it means:** Normal pace for expensive cards. Steady but not fast.
- **What to do:** Expect 60-120 days to sell. This is standard, not a problem.

**For $10K+ Cards:**
- **What it means:** Medium eBay activity is typical. Trophy cards move slowly even in healthy times.
- **What to do:** Consider auction houses if you need a guaranteed sale within a specific timeframe.

---

#### 🟠 **Low Score (0.2-0.5): Slower Sales**

**For Cards Under $100:**
- **What it means:** Weak demand. Card is probably too common or people aren't interested anymore.
- **What to do:** Price low if you want to sell, or accept it might take a while.

**For $100-$499 Cards:**
- **What it means:** Higher risk of sitting unsold. Sales take time even at fair prices.
- **What to do:** Need competitive pricing. Expect to wait several months.

**For $500-$2K Cards:**
- **What it means:** Normal for many cards in this range. Not great, but not broken.
- **What to do:** Price at or slightly below recent sales for reasonable turnover (60-90 days). This range requires patience.

**For $2K-$10K Cards:**
- **What it means:** Expected for expensive cards. Small pool of buyers, long decision times.
- **What to do:** This is normal. Expect 90-180+ days to sell. Focus on pricing it right.

**For $10K+ Cards:**
- **What it means:** Standard for eBay at this level. Most action happens at auction houses.
- **What to do:** eBay might not be the best place to sell. Auction houses find better buyers.

---

#### 🔴 **Very Low Score (<0.2): Very Few Sales**

**For Cards Under $100:**
- **What it means:** Not much demand. Card has little trading activity.
- **What to do:** Long hold or big discount needed to sell.

**For $100-$499 Cards:**
- **What it means:** Very hard to sell. Significant risk.
- **What to do:** Price well below recent sales to attract buyers, or wait for something to create interest (player comeback, etc.).

**For $500-$2K Cards:**
- **What it means:** Limited sales activity. Could be seasonal, could be real.
- **What to do:** Research carefully. Is this normal for this specific card, or is interest actually weak? Might take 90-180+ days to sell.

**For $2K-$10K Cards:**
- **What it means:** Thin eBay market. Not necessarily bad—expensive cards often sell privately or through auctions.
- **What to do:** Expected for niche cards (unusual grades, rare variations). If it's a mainstream Hall of Fame player, this suggests the price is too high or condition issues.

**For $10K+ Cards:**
- **What it means:** eBay isn't the main market for this card.
- **What to do:** For selling, use Heritage/PWCC/Goldin. For buying, eBay might have deals from sellers avoiding auction fees, but verify the card is real and as described.

## Plain Language Principles Applied

**Changes made to increase accessibility:**

1. **Removed jargon:** "Liquidity" → "How easy to sell"; "Absorption ratio" → "Selling faster than new listings appear"
2. **Eliminated financial terms:** "Market equilibrium" → "Normal, stable"; "Price discovery" → "Finding the right price"
3. **Concrete outcomes:** Instead of "elevated exit risk" → "hard to sell" or "might take 90+ days"
4. **Conversational tone:** "Let's be real" style rather than formal market analysis
5. **Practical focus:** Every section answers "what does this mean for me?" in plain terms
6. **Avoided assumptions:** Explained why things happen, not just that they happen
7. **Used comparisons:** "More cards selling than being listed" vs. technical ratios
8. **Real-world context:** "Player did something big" instead of "market catalyst"

This version maintains all the tier-specific guidance while being accessible to someone who's never studied markets or economics.
