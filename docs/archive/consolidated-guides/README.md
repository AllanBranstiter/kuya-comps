## Historical Context

PRICE_TIER_GUIDE.md was created as a focused quick-reference guide for tier-specific guidance. However, as the content evolved, it became a complete duplicate of a major section within MARKET_MESSAGES_GUIDE.md. Maintaining duplicate content across two files created maintenance overhead and risk of inconsistency, leading to this consolidation.
